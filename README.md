# QR-code_Generators
Without / With InterFace

Firstly you need to install qr-qode lib (pip install qrcode[pil]) to work with codes,
Next step is to install\upgrade (pip install qrcode[pil] customtkinter pillow) (pip install --upgrade customtkinter qrcode[pil] pillow) customtkinter to create interfaces

You would probably think why didn't i use the askcolor function from the filedialog and i will tell you IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL, it only crashed my programm, and because of that i tried to use old style form of choosing the color

Programm is not so simple for the absolute beginers as me, but it gives enough information about creating your own functions and interfaces with good functional at it
